Data for predicting financial time series prices in general includes:

1. Market data
2. Fundamental data
3. Alternative data.

For know we only implement features generation for market data. 

The simplest way to use the package is to use `Features` class, which creates all features:

```{r}
data(spy_hour)
# OhlcvInstance = Ohlcv$new(spy_hour, date_col = "datetime")
# FeaturesInstance = Features$new(OhlcvInstance,
#                                 at = c(300:315, 1000:1100),
#                                 lag = 1L)
# x = FeaturesInstance$get_features()
# tail(x)
```
